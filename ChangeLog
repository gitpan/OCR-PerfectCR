  -- Correct a stupid error -- I uploaded a not-the-most-recent tarball.
  -- Turns out that the PNG files made by GD aren't as portable as I'd 
	like -- that is, it doesn't produce exactly byte-for-byte the same png
	when run on the same image on different computers... so the md5 sums 
	are no longer based on the PNG, but on my own image format.  This 
	makes charmap files portable between computers.  (But not compatable 
	with charmaps from 0.01, which shouldn't be a problem, as it was only 
	out for 4 days.)
