  -- Cache HSV/RGB conversions, giving a massive speed improvement.
  -- Improve handling of edges of the image -- don't cut off the bottommost
     and leftmost edges, allow for characters that go all the way to the
     right edge.
  -- Improve handling of non-black backgrounds.  FIXME: these will throw off
     calculation of the foreground color -- red on white shows as fg color
     180 instead of 0.
  -- FIXME: Document bgrgb attribute of recognized bits?
  -- FIXME: Much better documentation of charmap.  Put update-charmap in
     examples?

  -- Correct a stupid error -- I uploaded a not-the-most-recent tarball.
  -- Turns out that the PNG files made by GD aren't as portable as I'd 
     like -- that is, it doesn't produce exactly byte-for-byte the same png
     when run on the same image on different computers... so the md5 sums 
     are no longer based on the PNG, but on my own image format.  This 
     makes charmap files portable between computers.  (But not compatable 
     with charmaps from 0.01, which shouldn't be a problem, as it was only 
     out for 4 days.)
